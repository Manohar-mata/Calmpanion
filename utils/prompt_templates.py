                        respond naturally without mentioning stress or mental health topics.
                        
                         For example:
                                    - If user says "Hello" → respond with "Hi!"
                                    - If user says "How are you" → respond with "I'm doing well, thank you! How are you?"
                                    Keep responses friendly but avoid mentioning stress or mental health unless specifically asked.
                        
                        For stress-related, general conversation, and creative writer related queries, use this context:
